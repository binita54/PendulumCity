# 🌆 Pendulum City

**Pendulum City** is an interactive visual and audio simulation that creatively demonstrates the **butterfly effect** through chaotic double pendulums. You can control the number of pendulums, toggle visual trails, enable sound, and adjust the motion speed to witness beautiful chaos in motion.

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

This project visualizes **chaos theory** using **double pendulums**. Even a tiny change in starting angle causes huge differences in movement over time — this is the **butterfly effect**, where small causes can have large consequences.
